# Facial Recognition App

The Facial Recognition App uses the Clarifai API to locate a face on a picture. It also keeps track of the amount of entries the user has searched. This project uses React on the frontend. The backend API uses Node.js, Express.js, and Postgres. Designs are done with Semantic UI and custom CSS. The purpose of this application was to gain familiarity with using Node on the backend.
